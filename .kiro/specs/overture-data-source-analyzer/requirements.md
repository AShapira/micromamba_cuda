# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature expands the existing building source investigation capabilities to create a comprehensive data source analyzer for Overture Maps feature types. The system will investigate, analyze, and visualize the different data sources contributing to various Overture Maps feature types (buildings, places, transportation, divisions, etc.) through interactive charts and maps. This builds upon the existing BuildingRetriever functionality to provide a more generalized and user-friendly analysis tool.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a geospatial data analyst, I want to analyze data source composition across different Overture Maps feature types, so that I can understand data coverage and quality patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select an Overture Maps feature type (buildings, places, transportation, divisions) THEN the system SHALL load and index the corresponding GeoParquet data
2. WHEN I specify a geographic area of interest THEN the system SHALL retrieve all features within that area and analyze their data sources
3. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide source attribution statistics including counts and percentages by data source
4. IF the selected feature type contains source metadata THEN the system SHALL extract and categorize all unique data sources
5. WHEN multiple feature types are analyzed THEN the system SHALL support comparative analysis across feature types

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to visualize data source distribution through interactive charts, so that I can quickly identify patterns and gaps in data coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN source analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate interactive bar charts showing feature counts by data source
2. WHEN displaying source statistics THEN the system SHALL show both absolute counts and percentage distributions
3. WHEN multiple geographic areas are analyzed THEN the system SHALL create comparative visualizations across regions
4. WHEN temporal data is available THEN the system SHALL support time-series visualization of source contributions
5. IF source confidence scores exist THEN the system SHALL incorporate quality metrics into visualizations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a GIS professional, I want to visualize data source distribution on interactive maps, so that I can understand spatial patterns of data coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN geographic analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL create interactive maps showing feature distribution by data source
2. WHEN displaying map visualizations THEN the system SHALL use distinct colors/symbols for different data sources
3. WHEN users interact with map features THEN the system SHALL display detailed source attribution information
4. WHEN analyzing large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement efficient spatial aggregation and clustering
5. IF multiple feature types are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide layer controls for selective visualization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data quality analyst, I want to configure analysis parameters and geographic boundaries, so that I can focus on specific regions and data characteristics of interest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting an analysis THEN the system SHALL allow selection of specific Overture Maps feature types
2. WHEN defining study areas THEN the system SHALL support bounding box, polygon, and administrative boundary selection
3. WHEN configuring analysis THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by data source, confidence scores, or other metadata
4. WHEN processing large areas THEN the system SHALL provide options for spatial sampling and aggregation levels
5. IF custom geographic boundaries are provided THEN the system SHALL accept and process user-defined study areas

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export analysis results and visualizations, so that I can integrate findings into reports and other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL export results to standard formats (GeoParquet, CSV, GeoJSON)
2. WHEN visualizations are created THEN the system SHALL support export to image formats (PNG, SVG) and interactive HTML
3. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive metadata about analysis parameters and data sources
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create summary statistics and data quality assessments
5. IF multiple analyses are performed THEN the system SHALL support batch export and comparison reporting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want the system to handle large datasets efficiently, so that I can analyze extensive geographic areas without excessive wait times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL utilize GPU acceleration where available (RAPIDS/cuDF)
2. WHEN analyzing multiple regions THEN the system SHALL implement parallel processing for independent areas
3. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL use streaming and chunked processing to manage resources
4. WHEN repeated analyses are performed THEN the system SHALL cache intermediate results and spatial indices
5. IF system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and allow cancellation of long-running operations
